answer to recent Wyncode question: FizzBuzz
A program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, however:

1) When the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.
2) When the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number.
3) When the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
